Fused operators combine multiple operations into a single, and streamlines kernel execution in a single step rather than separating them. The intuition behind fused operators is to reduce overhead by eliminating the need to write intermediate results to memory and then read them back in subsequent operations. This design minimizes both memory bandwidth usage and kernel launch overhead, which is particularly beneficial in deep learning models where such sequences are common.

This approach works for improving efficiency because it reduces the number of separate kernel invocations and data movements between the CPU/GPU and the slower main memory. As a result, more computations can be performed in parallel, leading to lower latency and higher throughput. Potential future improvements include further fusing additional common operations (like activation functions), optimizing the memory access patterns even further and tailoring fused kernels to exploit specific hardware architectures. These advancements could further decrease execution time and energy consumption in large-scale deep learning systems.
