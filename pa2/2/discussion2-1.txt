Discussion:
Our myAllreduce implementation runs at roughly 45% of the MPI.Allreduce time (0.000299 s vs. 0.000667 s). This is because the reduced overhead of performing a simple reduce-to-root followed by a broadcast, which is especially effective for small message sizes.The myAlltoall is about 135% of MPI.Alltoallâ€™s time (0.000681 s vs. 0.000504 s). This is probably due to theadded overhead from managing multiple non-blocking operations and data copies.
